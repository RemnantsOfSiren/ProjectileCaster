# ProjectileCaster

I wouldn't advice using this for production use, at the moment. Extremely experimental and only being uploaded for my own personal projects.

Server/Client based projectile hit detection.
--> you will need to just require the module on the client in-order for things to render. Prior I used emitLegacyScripts however it caused bytenet to throw issues
